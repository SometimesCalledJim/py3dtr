This program proceduaraly generates 3d terrain, then displays it.
It is written in Python and OpenGL.
Lib3d is a library I wrote for matrix operations and 3d math and quaternions.
Scene3d is a library I wrote for creating a "scene", basically an object containing all of the objects in a 3d environment.

	noise (for generating simplex noise to use in procedural generation)
Instructions:
	Launch final.py
Controls:
	WASD to move
	Shift and Ctrl to go up and down
